What is typeCharts?
===================

The typeCharts library is was created to provide an easier way for Typescript
programmers to create bar graphs.

Using this library, all you have to do is specify just a few variables (can be
seen in the examples) to display a bar graph on screen.



How Can You Help?
=================

If you have any new features, bug fixes or improvements, feel free to fork and
change this library to achieve many great things.



Thanks for your time,

Note:
=====

you have to compile the file which will be importing typeCharts.ts with the
--amd module

tsc --module amd <path to file>

This library also requires jQuery and requireJS, which can be included via CDN
or local files.
